  <p>Biryani, which originated in India, is a pilaf-style dish made of rice, aromatic spices, and meats (such as chicken, lamb, or fish). Making biryani can be a somewhat complex endeavor — but the wonderfully fragrant and filling finished product is well worth the effort. In this collection of our best chicken biryani recipes, you'll find traditional options as well as relatively quick and easy ideas you can make in your slow cooker or Instant Pot.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><small>1/4</small> cup ghee</li>
  <li>20 whole cloves</li>
  <li>9 whole gram cardamom pods</li>
  <li>5 bay leaves</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>
  <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups plain yogurt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li> fresh curry leaves (Optional)</li>
  <li>3 cups uncooked jasmine or white rice</li>
  <li>4 ⅛ cups water</li>
  <li>1 sprig cilantro leaves with stems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Direction</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
    <p>Soak rice for 30 minutes in enough water to cover; then drain.</p>
    <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
    <p>Meanwhile, heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in cloves, cardamom, and bay leaves. Then stir in onion, and cook until soft, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in chile peppers and ginger paste. Stir in yogurt, salt, and curry, and then place chicken in pan. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally and turning the chicken pieces, until only about 1 cup of liquid remains.</p>
